# mvc_controllers_and_methods_insertion_db
This project is a simple MVC application using PHP,it's a CRUD app
And for mastering the model I'v used Eloquent package it's easier to use for the interaction
between models and database 
I also used all relationships
this app has another good fonctionality that it can detect all controllers in the 'controllers' folder and for every controller lists all methods,
if a new controller is created then it'll add the name of controller in the 'controllers' table in the DB, and also if a method is created then the name of the method will be added in the methods table in DB
